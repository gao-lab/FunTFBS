FunTFBS is used for identifying transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBS) which have transcriptional regulatory functions.
Given a set of candidate TFBS set, for each binding site FunTFBS can filter for functional ones based on the correlation 
between frequencies in binding motif and conservation scores (the absolute values of PhyloP) across base pairs.

Prerequisite
=================

1. perl (5.010 or later)
   You can type "perl -v" to check for the version.
2. R (3.0.1 or later)
   You can type "R --version" to check for the version.
3. R package: data.table (1.10.4 or later)
   You can type "library("data.table")" in R environment to check for the version.
   If this package is not installed, just type "install.packages("data.table")" for installation.

Installation
=================

The "funTFBS" file can be run directly, also you can add this path to PATH environment variable.

export PATH=$PATH:/the path of this package

For testing the program, please run following command line:

funTFBS demo/test_100_TFBS.bed demo/Ath.meme meme demo/pp_value_10000.bed demo/Ath.fa test

If there is no error you will get two files in the "test" fold, which are identical with those in the "demo" fold.
test/TFBS_unfiltered.bed test/TFBS_filtered.bed

Usage
=================

funTFBS TFBS.bed motifs format phyloP.bg genome.fa output

The 4th column of TFBS.bed is used as TF ID, which should be matched with TF ID in the motifs file.

The phyloP.bg should be sorted by coordinate (sort -k 1,1 -k 2,2n).

The candidate TFBS which showed correlation will be kept as functional ones with following filtering cutoff:
[correlation score > 0] AND [correlation p-value <= 0.05]

After running it there will be two output files generated in the output directory, which are in bed6+ format (9 columns).

TFBS_unfiltered.bed: Total candidate TFBS before filtering.
TFBS_filtered.bed: Functional TFBS after filtering.

The header of the output files is:
chromosome  start  end  TF  value(not used)  strand  sequence  correlation(pearson)  p-value(correlation test)
